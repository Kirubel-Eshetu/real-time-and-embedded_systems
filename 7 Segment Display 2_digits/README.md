# 0 to 99 counter
- This is an Embedded C program to display numbers from 0 to 99 on two 7 segment displays by using AT89C51 microcontroller. <br />
- I have used Keli uVision5 IDE to build the C source code and Proteus for running the simulation. On the program two 7 segment display Anodes and AT89C51 microcontroller were used.

## How to run the program? 
On the project folder you will find:- 
- "7_Segment.c" -> C Source code, 
- "7_Segment_Display_2digits.uvproj" -> project file and 
- "7_segment_Display_2_Digits_simu.pdsprj" -> Simultaion of the project. 

Open the "7_Segment_Display_2digits.uvproj" project file using Keli uVision5 IDE (or your preffered IDE) and find the "7_Segment.c" source code file. By using the IDE, build the source code. After building the C source code, a HEX file is generated by the IDE. The generated HEX file can be found in "Objects" folder in the parent folder where the project is
located.  The generated HEX file must be attached to the AT89C51 microcontroller found in the implementaion. To do that, open Proteus (or your prefered simulation software) and attach the HEX file by double clicking on the microcontoller, find and option that says "Program File", on the right side you will see a "browse" icon. Click on that, find the hex file in the "objects" folder and select it. After that click on ok to save the progress. The "Edit Component" dialog box is closed and the HEX file will be attached successfully. 
This HEX file is very improtant for the simulation to function as it serve as an interface for connecting the source code with simulation. After linking the HEX file you can run the simlation to see the two 7 segment display ("7SEG-COM-ANODE" in technical terms) count from 00 to 99. The two 7 segment display are positioned side to side. The left and the right 7SEG-COM-ANODE displays the left and right digits respectively while maintaing the operation simultaneously.

## Where to apply the program?
- This counter can be practically used for the change of Traffic light from one light to another. For instance to change the light from Green to red we can use the counter by setting the countdown to a favourable number.
