# Multiple Traffic Signal
- This is an Embedded C program to simulate the control of traffic flow with the help of traffic lights on a crossroad scenario. <br />
- I have used Keli uVision5 IDE to program and build the C source code and Proteus for running the simulation. On the program 4 traffic lights and AT89C51 microcontroller were used. 

## How to run the program? 
On the project folder you will find 
- "Multi_traffic.c" -> C Source code
- "Multiple_Traffic.uvproj" -> project file and
- "Multiple_Traffic_Signal.pdsprj" -> Simultaion of the project.

Open the "Multiple_Traffic.uvproj" project file using Keli uVision5 IDE (or your preffered IDE) and find the "Mult_traffic.c" source code file. By using the IDE, build the source code. After building the C source code, a HEX file is generated by the IDE. The generated HEX file can be found in "Objects" folder in the parent folder where the project is located. The generated HEX file must be attached to the AT89C51 microcontroller found in the implementaion. To do that, open Proteus (or your prefered simulation software) and attach the HEX file by double clicking on the microcontoller, find and option that says "Program File", on the right side you will see a "browse" icon. Click on that, find the hex file in the "objects" folder and select it. After that click on ok to save the progress. The "Edit Component" dialog box is closed and the HEX file will be attached successfully. This HEX file is very improtant for the simulation to function as it serve as an interface for connecting the source code with simulation. After linking the HEX file you can run the simlation to see the four traffic light signals changing lights simultaneaously. The green lights up for the vehicles travelling on the X-axis of the cross road and the traffic light for the vehicles found on the Y-axis of the cross road turns red. The yellow light serves as an intermediary for changing light from green to red and vice versa. After yellow lights up on all the traffic lights, both the traffic lights on the X-axis turns red and both the traffic lights found on the Y-axis turn to green. The process repeats it self accordingly.

## Where to apply the program?
This traffic lights simulation can be practically used for controlling traffic flow on corss-roads.
