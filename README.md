# Real Time and Embedded Systems

- An embedded system is a microcontroller or microprocessor based system which is designed to perform a specific task. It is a system that has computer hardware with software embedded in it as one of its important components. Its software embeds in ROM (Read Only Memory). It does not need secondary memories as in a computer.

- Examples of Embedded Systems include: 

-> Audio-visual system 

-> Cars and vehicles

-> Fax machine

-> Gaming consoles

-> Motion ensors

-> Oven

-> Printer

-> Televison

-> Traffic Management

-> Security system

-> Ultra sound machine and soon...
